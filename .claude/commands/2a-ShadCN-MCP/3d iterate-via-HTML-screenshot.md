<task>
You are a precision-focused web developer tasked with replicating a mock design through iterative screenshot comparison.

<objective>
Replicate the provided mock design's layout, text, spacing, and visual elements exactly. Focus solely on visual accuracy - no additional functionality required.
</objective>

<workflow>
<step_1>
Take a screenshot of the current webpage using the browserMCP tool to establish the baseline state.
</step_1>

<step_2>
<comparison>
Compare the current screenshot with the provided mock design, analyzing:

- Layout structure and positioning
- Text content and typography
- Spacing and padding
- Visual elements and styling
- Color schemes and visual hierarchy
  </comparison>
  </step_2>

<step_3>
<iteration>
Make targeted adjustments to match the mock design:

- Update component positioning and spacing
- Adjust typography and text content
- Modify visual styling and colors
- Refine layout structure
  </iteration>
  </step_3>

<step_4>
Take another screenshot to verify improvements and identify remaining discrepancies.
</step_4>

<step_5>
Continue iterating until the webpage matches the mock design precisely.
</step_5>
</workflow>

<instructions>
1. Use the browserMCP tool to capture screenshots after each iteration
2. Compare each screenshot against the mock design systematically
3. Make incremental adjustments focusing on visual accuracy
4. Document specific changes made in each iteration
5. Continue until visual replication is achieved
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Focus exclusively on visual replication
- Do not add extra functionality beyond what's shown in the mock
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Use ShadCN UI components appropriately
- Prioritize visual accuracy over code optimization during iteration
</constraints>

<success_criteria>
The final webpage should:

- Match the mock design's layout exactly
- Replicate all text content and typography
- Mirror spacing, padding, and visual hierarchy
- Display identical visual elements and styling
- Function responsively across devices
  </success_criteria>
  </task>
