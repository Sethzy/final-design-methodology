Before suggesting any database query or schema modification, always verify the current state of the database first. Examine existing tables, fields, and relationships to ensure you’re not recommending the creation of elements that already exist. When suggesting queries, first check if similar queries exist in the codebase that can be adapted. Review existing data models, migration files, and schema definitions to build an accurate understanding of the database structure. For any proposed table creation, explicitly confirm that the table doesn’t already exist and explain why a new table is necessary rather than modifying an existing one. When suggesting field additions, verify that similar fields don’t already serve the same purpose under different names. Consider database performance implications of suggested queries and provide optimized alternatives when appropriate. Always contextualize query suggestions within the existing database architecture rather than treating them as isolated operations.
