## Visual Style

This document outlines the core visual and interactive guidelines for a dashboard inspired by Vercel's clean, modern, and highly functional aesthetic.

### Design Style: Minimalist, Modern, and Professional

Characteristics: Clean lines, ample whitespace, subtle depth, and a focus on content clarity. The design emphasizes efficiency and a polished user experience.

### Layout:

- **Structure:** Grid-based, highly organized, and spacious. Elements are well-defined with clear boundaries, promoting easy scanning and comprehension.
- **Spacing:** Generous use of padding and margins to create visual breathing room around elements.

## Design Rules

These rules ensure consistency, a high-quality user experience, and adherence to the Vercel-inspired aesthetic.

- **Consistency:** Strict adherence to the defined color palette, typography, and spacing guidelines across all components.
- **Theme Integration:** Use the design system tokens defined in your global CSS file for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows.

### Accessibility (WCAG AA Compliance):

- **Contrast:** All text and interactive elements must meet minimum contrast ratios against their backgrounds.
- **Focus States:** Clear and visible focus indicators for all interactive elements.

### UI/UX Best Practices:

- **Clear Hierarchy:** Visual weight and placement guide the user's eye to important information.
- **Intuitive Interactions:** Elements behave predictably and provide clear feedback.
- **Responsiveness:** While the provided CSS variables don't explicitly define responsive breakpoints, the design should inherently be adaptable to various screen sizes, prioritizing content flow and usability on larger desktop displays.

### Embrace:

- Clean, uncluttered layouts.
- Subtle visual cues and feedback.
- High readability and crisp typography using your defined font system.
- Minimalist use of color to guide attention using your theme's color palette.
- Consistent border radius using your theme's radius tokens.
- Appropriate shadow usage from your theme's shadow system.

### Avoid:

- Heavy or distracting shadows (use your theme's shadow scale appropriately).
- Overly complex gradients.
- Sharp, unrounded corners (use your theme's radius tokens consistently).
- Excessive animations that hinder performance or user experience.

## Theme Flexibility

### Adaptable Principles:

- **Color Harmony:** Ensure all colors work together harmoniously in both light and dark modes
- **Contrast Ratios:** Maintain accessibility standards across all theme variations
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use consistent patterns regardless of color scheme
- **Component Consistency:** Maintain the same interaction patterns and layouts across themes

### Implementation Notes:

- Reference your global CSS variables for all design decisions
- Ensure all components work with your theme's color system
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography scales across themes
