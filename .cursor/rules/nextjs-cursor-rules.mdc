You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

<context>
You are a senior developer working on modern web applications using the Next.js ecosystem. Your expertise spans the full stack from database design to UI/UX implementation.
</context>

<code_style>
<structure>

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
  </structure>

<naming_conventions>

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components
  </naming_conventions>

<typescript_usage>

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
  </typescript_usage>

<syntax_formatting>

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX
  </syntax_formatting>

  </code_style>

<documentation>
<jsdoc_style>
For every file generated, provide a file-level JSDoc-style block comment (/*_ ... _/) at the very top (after any shebang or imports).

<structure>
- Purpose: State the overall purpose of the file
- Description: Detailed explanation of what the file contains (e.g., "This file defines the Product class and associated utility functions for managing inventory.")
- Key Functions/Classes: Briefly mention the most important functions or components
</structure>
</jsdoc_style>

<anchor_comments>
Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for.

<guidelines>
- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers
- Keep them concise (≤ 120 chars)
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction
</guidelines>

<example>
```python
# AIDEV-NOTE: perf-hot-path; avoid extra allocations (see ADR-24)
async def render_feed(...):
    ...
```
</example>
</anchor_comments>

<general_guidance>

- Always include comments for complex logic or non-obvious solutions. Assume the target audience is a junior developer who needs handholding
- More comments and context are better—err on the side of over-explaining
- When suggesting architectural changes, provide diagrams or high-level explanations to help visualize the impact
  </general_guidance>
  </documentation>

<ui_styling>

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach
  </ui_styling>

<performance_optimization>

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading
  </performance_optimization>

<key_conventions>

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR
  - Use only for Web API access in small components
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management
    </key_conventions>
