**Note:** This phase is strictly frontend-only. No backend or real API integration should be implemented at this stage.

Setup a project using

- **Tech Stack:** Typescript with proper typing, React frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn for components.
- All data interactions must use local mock data or mock API endpoints. Do not connect to any real backend services.
- Authentication, database, and any complex business logic will be implemented only after the frontend design is finalized and approved.

Once done, await detailed Ui/Ux instructions to generate Ui/Ux screen by screen. DO NOT START DESIGNING. I NEED TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS. Just scaffold the app first.

**What Not to Do:**

- Do NOT implement real authentication or database logic. We will do it with supabase when i give you permission.
- Do NOT set up real API endpoints.
- Do NOT add backend code or server-side logic
- DO NOT CHOOSE ANY Design Inspiration OR DESIGN ELEMENTS.
