Design a comprehensive UI implementation plan for a web application interface, ensuring clarity, modularity, and actionable steps for developers and designers.
</objective>

<context>
You are a UX/UI architect tasked with translating high-level product requirements into a detailed, structured implementation plan. The plan should be easy to follow, prioritize user experience, and be adaptable for future enhancements.

<instructions>
1. Begin with a concise overview of the application and its primary user flows.
2. Break down the interface into major sections or pages (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Detail Page).
3. For each section, specify:
   - Layout and navigation elements
   - Key components and their hierarchy
   - Content and data priorities
   - Responsive/adaptive considerations
4. Use clear headings and bullet points for readability.
5. Where appropriate, suggest reusable UI patterns or components.
6. Structure your output using markdown for sections and lists.
7. Reference the provided example for formatting and depth.

<examples>
<example>
<scenario>User requests a dashboard for managing MCP servers, with login and detail views.</scenario>
<user_input>
I would like to make an interface for a site. The site would have a login page, then the dashboard, or even before that. Basically, what I want to build is a place with the login, and they have these MCP servers. They open that MCP, they have these lists of cards of MCP servers, and they open if they open one up, then we have the MCP server image at the top, then some details, then some installation. The installation would also be in those card-type bubbles and all that. That is what I want.
