Approach API integration with a comprehensive strategy for requests, responses, and error handling. Verify authentication headers, parameters, and body format for each request. Implement proper error handling for all network operations with specific catches for different error types. Ensure consistent typing between request payloads, expected responses, and application state. Configure proper CORS settings and verify they work across all environments. Implement intelligent retry mechanisms for transient failures with exponential backoff. Consider rate limiting implications and implement appropriate throttling. Add strategic request caching to improve performance and reduce server load. Monitor network performance including request timing and payload sizes. Test API integrations against both happy paths and various failure scenarios. Maintain clear documentation of all API endpoints, their purposes, expected parameters, and response formats to facilitate future development and debugging.
