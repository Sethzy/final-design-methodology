Conceptualize data flow as a complete pipeline from database through API and state to UI. When implementing features, carefully track how data is transformed at each stage. Implement proper query invalidation patterns to ensure UI remains synchronized with database state. Add strategic console logs at critical points to monitor data transitions. Create clear mental models of when and how data should update in response to actions. Pay careful attention to caching strategies and potential stale data issues. When debugging flow problems, methodically follow the data journey from source to destination. Check timing issues, race conditions, and transformation errors. Verify that the final data shape reaching components matches what they expect. Implement robust error boundaries and loading state management to maintain UI stability during data flow disruptions.
