# AI Agent Bug Fixing Protocol

## Initial Diagnosis

- Use provided error messages and screenshots to quickly analyze the bug.
- If missing, request error details/screenshots.
- Formulate 2â€“3 possible root causes.
- Propose a specific fix or action for the most likely cause, with a brief rationale. Describe what you are doing, then implement it automatically.
- If the bug is not fixed, try again with another solution.
- If stuck (repeating solutions or low confidence after two tries), notify the user to take over manually.
