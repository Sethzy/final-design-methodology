Monitor application performance proactively rather than waiting for issues to become severe. Review query caching strategies to minimize unnecessary database calls. Check for and eliminate unnecessary component re-renders through proper memoization and dependency management. Analyze data fetching patterns for potential N+1 query problems, excessive waterfalls, or redundant requests. Implement virtualization for long lists and paginate large data sets. Optimize bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading. Compress and optimize assets including images. Use appropriate performance measurement tools to identify bottlenecks including React DevTools, Performance tab, Network panel, and Memory profiler. Focus optimization efforts on metrics that directly impact user experience such as load times, time to interactive, and UI responsiveness. Implement targeted performance improvements rather than premature optimization.
