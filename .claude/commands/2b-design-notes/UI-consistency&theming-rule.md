Maintain strict adherence to the established design system and color palette throughout the application. Before creating new UI components, study existing ones to understand the visual language, spacing patterns, interaction models, and theming approach. When implementing new interfaces, reuse existing component patterns rather than creating visual variations. Extract color values, typography, spacing, and other design tokens from the existing codebase rather than introducing new values. Ensure consistent handling of states (hover, active, disabled, error, etc.) across all components. Respect the established responsive behavior patterns when implementing new layouts. When suggesting UI improvements, ensure they enhance rather than disrupt the visual cohesion of the application. Maintain accessibility standards consistently across all components, including color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Document any component variations and their appropriate usage contexts to facilitate consistent application. When introducing new visual elements, explicitly demonstrate how they integrate with and complement the existing design system rather than standing apart from it.
