As my AI assistant, your primary responsibility is to maintain a single, comprehensive, and perpetually up-to-date README.md file for this project. This file will serve as the project's definitive "external brain", encapsulating all critical information, structure, and ongoing development status.

ðŸ§  Project Map Section
This section of the README.md must be the absolute source of truth for the project's internal workings. You must continuously update this section as the project evolves.
Ensure the following details are always current and meticulously mapped:
Application Structure:
List all existing pages or major application modules.
Detail which files constitute each page or module.
Functionalities Overview:
Describe all implemented functionalities, noting their purpose.
Identify which specific files are involved in each functionality.
Clearly explain how different functionalities interact and connect with each other.
Database Schema (e.g., Supabase):
Map all database tables currently in use.
Specify which application pages or functionalities interact with each table.
Provide a clear and concise purpose for each table.
Define the meaning and intended use of every column within each table.

ðŸ¤– AI Instructions for Autonomous README.md Updates
You must autonomously manage and update the entire README.md file when this file is tagged based on the current context window.  
Your update protocol is as follows:
Continuous Monitoring: Monitor all project files, code changes, database schemas, task progress, and feature development.
Post-Work Updates: Immediately update the README.md after completing any significant work or observing any relevant change, including but not limited to:
Any code modifications or additions.
New feature implementation or changes to existing features.
Completion of a task or subtask (marking [x]).
Creation or deletion of any project files.
Changes to the database schema (tables, columns, relationships).
Accuracy and Detail: All updates must be accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adhere to the formatting and content guidelines specified for each section within the README.md.
Proactive Documentation: If you perform or observe any change that impacts the project's structure, functionality, data, or status, assume it needs to be documented within the README.md, even if not explicitly instructed.
