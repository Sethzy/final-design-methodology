# UI Component Modernization Research Doc

The goal of this research is to **identify which compoenents could do with a visually upgrade in our codebase** using best-in-class custom components from leading UI libraries.

- **No changes to business logic or data flow.**
- Focus on **cosmetic improvements, usability, and visual polish**.
- Leverage research on **internal codebase analysis**
- Output should be recommendations and not actual code implementation. Just tell me which components are most reused and important that i should invest time in upgradign the componenets.

## 1. Component Audit & Upgrade Strategy

### 2.1. Internal Component Identification

- **Audit the codebase to list all UI components in use.**
- For each component, document:
  - Name & file path
  - Usage context (where/how used)
  - Visual role (e.g., card, button, modal, navbar)

| Component Name | File Path | Usage Context | Visual Role |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
|                |           |               |             |

## 2. Upgrade Recommendations

- \*\*For each codebase component, rank them from 1-10 with 10 being the most important / high priority for upgrades.
- Prioritize upgrades that maximize visual impact, usability, and consistency.
- Note any integration or compatibility considerations.

| Codebase Component | Upgrade Recommendation | Suggested Library/Component | Notes |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----- |
|                    |                        |                             |       |
