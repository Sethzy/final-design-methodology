**Option 1: DIY and import via pnpm**

Implement 21st dev component as a reference componenet using pnpm: Install all dependencies.
Do not import it to the main app or override the exsiting component yet. We will handle this separately.

Before importing it, examine the current coding patterns and tell me what complexity you foresee might occur when hooking up the logic.

Import it, then change the styling to fit global CSS. Then change the componenet to fit your needs. Do it step by step.

Do not ask AI to one shot it. It will not work.

**Option 2: use lovable to import**

There’s a custom prompt in 21st dev.

It is better to create this from scratch when you don’t have any components yet. (Not sure?)

If that’s the case, map out all the components in 21st dev that you want to implement later. Make sure it’s in a PRD.

Use the edit button in lovable. It’s lets you work with the margins in a drag and drop fashion

**Option 3: Extension**

Always create it a separate reference component, and then ask AI to import it directly.

It should now work because it's ShadCN UI. Ask it to examine the initial componenet prompt very carefully first.

Forked stagewise. Use it to directly apply ShadCN components to your codebase.
